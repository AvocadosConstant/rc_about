##Current Issues
- Value graphic and text stop scaling to screen size when width < 916. Not sure where that number comes from.
- Loads of trouble with the mobile responsiveness. I'm using a lot of % widths which I don't believe is the best way to do this. Need some pointers on common practices etc.
- Scaling of the banner.
- Spacing isn't exact because my only reference is a pdf file.
